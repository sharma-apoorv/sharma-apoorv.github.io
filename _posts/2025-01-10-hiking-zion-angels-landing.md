## The Approach

Standing at the base of Zion's Angels Landing trail, looking up at the narrow spine of rock, I felt my palms start to sweat. This wasn't going to be just another hike.

**Stats:**
- **Distance:** 5.4 miles round trip
- **Elevation gain:** 1,488 feet
- **Difficulty:** Strenuous (and that's putting it mildly)
- **Drop-off:** 1,000+ feet on both sides at the summit

## The Journey

### Walter's Wiggles
The first real challenge - 21 steep switchbacks carved into the rock face. By the time I reached Scout Lookout, my legs were burning and I was questioning my life choices.

### The Decision Point
Scout Lookout is where most people turn back. It's where you can see the final half-mile: a narrow ridge with chains bolted into the rock, sheer drops on both sides, and crowds of hikers navigating the exposed spine.

I sat there for 10 minutes, watching people make the ascent. Then I remembered something from the Bhagavad Gita:

> *"You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action."*

This wasn't about reaching the summit. It was about taking the next step.

## The Lesson

What I learned on that ridge:
1. **Fear is information, not a stop sign** - It tells you to be careful, not to quit
2. **Focus on the next step** - Not the whole journey, just the next handhold
3. **Trust the process** - Millions have done this before; the path is tested
4. **Presence is everything** - One distracted moment and... well, don't be distracted

## The Summit

When I finally pulled myself onto the summit, the view was... honestly, it was secondary to what I felt inside. Pride? Relief? Gratitude?

All of the above.

But more than that - a reminder that we're capable of far more than we think. We just need to:
- Start where we are
- Use what we have
- Take the next step

## Practical Tips

If you're considering this hike:

- **Get there early** - Before 7 AM to beat crowds and heat
- **Proper footwear** - Grippy soles are non-negotiable
- **Gloves** - The chains get hot and rough
- **Water** - At least 2L per person
- **Know your limits** - There's no shame in turning back

## The Connection

Standing on that ridge, holding onto chains, negotiating with my fear - it felt remarkably like spiritual practice.

Both require:
- Faith in something you can't fully see
- Courage to keep going when it's uncomfortable
- Trust in the process
- Presence in each moment

Maybe that's why I love hiking so much. It's meditation in motion.
