## The Question That Changes Everything

"Who am I?"

Three simple words. Yet when truly investigated, they have the power to dissolve decades of conditioning and reveal something profound beneath the surface of our everyday consciousness.

## The Practice

In the tradition of **Sanatan Dharm**, particularly through the teachings of Ramana Maharshi, self-inquiry (*Atma Vichara*) isn't about finding an intellectual answer. It's about:

1. **Turning attention inward** - Instead of constantly looking outside for fulfillment
2. **Questioning assumptions** - Am I this body? These thoughts? These emotions?
3. **Resting in awareness** - Finding the unchanging witness behind all experience

## My Journey

When I first encountered this practice, I thought it was too simple to be profound. I was wrong.

After months of consistent inquiry, I began noticing:
- Thoughts arise and pass, but something remains
- Emotions come and go, but the observer is constant
- The body changes daily, but awareness persists

## The Debug Process

As someone who debugs code professionally, I realized self-inquiry is debugging consciousness itself:

```python
def debug_self():
    while True:
        experience = observe_current_moment()
        ask("To whom does this experience occur?")
        trace_back_to_source()
        # The bug isn't in the code - it's in identifying as the code
```

## Practical Steps

If you're curious to try:

1. **Sit quietly** for 10-15 minutes daily
2. **Notice your thoughts** as they arise
3. **Ask sincerely** - "Who is observing these thoughts?"
4. **Don't intellectualize** - Feel into the question
5. **Rest** in whatever reveals itself

## The Transformation

This practice hasn't made my life perfect, but it has:
- Reduced identification with passing mental states
- Created space between stimulus and response
- Revealed a deeper sense of peace beneath surface turbulence
