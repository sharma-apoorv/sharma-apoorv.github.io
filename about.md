# About Me

## The Journey

I'm **Apoorv**, and my life has been a constant quest to understand the Self - not just the technical bugs in code, but the deeper patterns that shape who we are and how we experience life.

### Five Countries, One Quest

My journey has taken me across:
- **India** - Where my roots lie and spirituality first called to me
- **Thailand** - Land of smiles and Buddhist wisdom
- **Singapore** - Where East meets West in perfect harmony
- **China** - Ancient culture meets modern innovation
- **USA** - Wide open spaces and endless possibilities

### Into the Wild

There's something profound about standing at the edge of a canyon, hiking through ancient forests, or camping under star-filled skies. I've explored numerous national parks across the USA, and each trail has taught me something new about resilience, perspective, and presence.

### The Inner Work

I'm beginning to explore spiritual practice through Sanatan Dharm - ancient principles that have guided seekers for thousands of years. Through meditation, self-reflection, and learning from these timeless teachings, I'm taking my first steps toward understanding the patterns and conditioning that shape how I see myself and the world.

### Learning Never Stops

I'm an avid consumer of self-help books and podcasts, always looking for insights that can make life a little better, a little clearer. This blog is where I synthesize and share those learnings - not as a guru, but as a fellow traveler on the path.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Spirituality**: Deep dives into Sanatan Dharm, meditation practices, and spiritual philosophy
- **Travel**: Stories and lessons from the road, hiking adventures, and cultural observations
- **Productivity**: Practical insights from books, podcasts, and personal experiments in optimization

## Let's Connect

This is a space for dialogue, not monologue. If something resonates with you, or if you have questions or insights to share, I'd love to hear from you.
