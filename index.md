Hi, I'm **Apoorv** - a seeker, traveler, and perpetual learner on a mission to debug not just code, but life itself.

I've called 5 countries home (India, Thailand, Singapore, China, and the USA), explored countless trails across national parks, and spent years diving deep into productivity and self-discovery.

This space is where I share my notes, insights, and adventures through the lens of spirituality, outdoor exploration, and continuous self-improvement. Think of it as my digital notebook - raw, honest, and always evolving.
